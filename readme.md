# Project Title

This repository contains a submission for the Unity ML-Agents Challenge. The project consists of two folders, python and Space Shooter AI. 

The folder, python, contains the jupyter notebook files and the curriculum learning json file. Also, it contains the most recent build of the Unity environment, SpaceShooter.exe.

The folder, Space Shooter AI, contains a modified version of the Space Shooter demo project that is available in the Unity Asset Store. This project has been modified extensively to allow for the creation of multiple games in one scene.
